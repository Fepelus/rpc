Reverse-Polish calculator

## Modules

This project consists of three modules:

* The *Calculator* library that maintains the stack of the current calculation and the operations on it.
* A *CLI* that parses calculations from the command line and sends them to the library
* A *Flutter* mobile application that operates as the GUI for the library.
